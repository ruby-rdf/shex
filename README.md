## Features

* 100% pure Ruby with minimal dependencies and no bloat.
* Fully compatible with [ShEx][ShExSpec] specifications.
* 100% free and unencumbered [public domain](https://unlicense.org/) software.

## Description

The ShEx gem implements a [ShEx][ShExSpec] Shape Expression engine version 2.0.

* `ShEx::Parser` parses ShExC and ShExJ formatted documents generating executable operators which can be serialized as [S-Expressions][].
* `ShEx::Algebra` executes operators against Any `RDF::Graph`, including compliant [RDF.rb][].
* [Implementation Report](file.earl.html)

## Examples
### Validating a node using ShExC

    require 'rdf/turtle'
    require 'shex'

    shexc = %(
      PREFIX doap:  <http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#>
      PREFIX dc:    <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
      PREFIX ex:    <http://example.com/>

      ex:TestShape EXTRA a {
        a [doap:Project];
        ( doap:name Literal;
          doap:description Literal
        | dc:title Literal;
          dc:description Literal)+;
        doap:category    IRI*;
        doap:developer   IRI+;
        doap:implements [<http://shex.io/shex-semantics/>]
      }
    )
    graph = RDF::Graph.load("etc/doap.ttl")
    schema = ShEx.parse(shexc)
    map = {
      RDF::URI("https://rubygems.org/gems/shex") => RDF::URI("http://example.com/TestShape")
    }
    schema.satisfies?(graph, map)
    # => true
### Validating a node using ShExJ

    }
    schema.satisfies?(graph, map)
    # => true

## Extensions
ShEx has an extension mechanism using [Semantic Actions](http://shex.io/shex-semantics/#semantic-actions). Extensions may be implemented in Ruby ShEx by sub-classing {ShEx::Extension} and implementing {ShEx::Extension#visit} and possibly {ShEx::Extension#initialize}, {ShEx::Extension#enter}, {ShEx::Extension#exit}, and {ShEx::Extension#close}. The `#visit` method will be called as part of the `#satisfies?` operation.

    require 'shex'
    class ShEx::Test < ShEx::Extension("http://shex.io/extensions/Test/")
      # (see ShEx::Extension#initialize)
      def initialize(schema: nil, logger: nil, depth: 0, **options)
        ...
      end

      # (see ShEx::Extension#visit)
      def visit(code: nil, matched: nil, expression: nil, depth: 0, **options)
        ...
      end
    end

The `#enter` method will be called on any {ShEx::Algebra::TripleExpression} that includes a {ShEx::Algebra::SemAct} referencing the extension, while the `#exit` method will be called on exit, even if not satisfied.

The `#initialize` method is called when {ShEx::Algebra::Schema#execute} starts and `#close` called on exit, even if not satisfied.

To make sure your extension is found, make sure to require it before the shape is executed.

## Command Line
When the `linkeddata` gem is installed, RDF.rb includes a `rdf` executable which acts as a wrapper to perform a number of different
operations on RDF files, including ShEx. The commands specific to ShEx is 

* `shex`: Validate repository given shape

Using this command requires either a `shex-input` where the ShEx schema is URI encoded, or `shex`, which references a URI or file path to the schema. Other required options are `shape` and `focus`.

Example usage:

    rdf shex https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby-rdf/shex/develop/etc/doap.ttl \
      --schema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby-rdf/shex/develop/etc/doap.shex \
      --focus https://rubygems.org/gems/shex

## Documentation

<https://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-rdf/shex>


## Implementation Notes
The ShExC parser uses the [EBNF][] gem to generate a [PEG][] parser.

The parser uses the executable [S-Expressions][] generated from the EBNF ShExC grammar to create a set of executable {ShEx::Algebra} Operators which are directly executed to perform shape validation.

## Contributing

This repository uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to mange development and release activity. All submissions _must_ be on a feature branch based on the _develop_ branch to ease staging and integration.

* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.
  Before committing, run `git diff --check` to make sure of this.
* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the
  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.
* Don't touch the `.gemspec` or `VERSION` files. If you need to change them,
  do so on your private branch only.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the
  corresponding list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.
* Don't touch the `AUTHORS` file. If your contributions are significant
  enough, be assured we will eventually add you in there.
* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule
  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an
  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you,
  which you will be asked to agree to on the first commit to a repo within the organization.
  Note that the agreement applies to all repos in the [Ruby RDF](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/) organization.
